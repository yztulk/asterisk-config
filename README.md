# Asterisk Configuration Manuals
This repository contains configuration files and manuals on how to install Asterisk and OpenVPN.

# Things left to do and sorted on priority basis
- Asterisk to auto start after power loss
- Build scenario #2
- Install VNC so dad and I can share screens 
- Get access to Asterisk by means of the public IP address even though the Asterisk server is registred as a VPN client
- Build Rofem website

# Security (todo)
- Restrict access to vpn clients so that they can't ping internal ip addresses. As a VPN client you can ping internal IP addresses.
- Run Asterisk as a user, not as root
- SSH not on port 22
