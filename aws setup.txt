Security groups
For each client that want to connect to the asterisk server these two items have to be added to the security group:
- Port 5060, Protocol udp, Source [external-ip-address]/32
- Port 10001 - 20000, Protocol udp, Source ource [external-ip-address]/32

Connect with Asterisk through a softphone by usering the IPv4 Public IP (e.g. 52.87.148.169)
